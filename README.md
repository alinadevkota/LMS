## Creating an admin user
First we’ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:

`$ python manage.py createsuperuser` <br>
Enter your desired username and press enter. <br>

`Username: admin ` <br>
You will then be prompted for your desired email address: <br>

`Email address: admin@example.com` <br>
The final step is to enter your password. You will be asked to enter your password twice, the second time as a confirmation of the first. <br>

```
Password: **********<br>
Password (again): *********<br>
Superuser created successfully.<br>
```


## Django Admin
The Django admin site is activated by default after running `$ python manage.py runserver`<br>
Now, open a Web browser and go to “/admin/” on your local domain – e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. You should see the admin’s login screen.


## APIs
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ to explore the API. You only can explore APIs after you login to Django Admin screen using superuser access.
